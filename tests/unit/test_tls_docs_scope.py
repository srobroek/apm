"""T3: the #2005 docs/CHANGELOG must scope OS-trust honestly.

Round-1 shipped copy claiming ``apm run`` child runtimes (incl. ``codex``)
re-run the OS-trust bootstrap. That was a field no-op for the ``llm`` venv and
never true for the Node/Rust runtimes. These tests are the silent-drift guard
that keeps the prose scoped to what actually ships: ``apm install`` plus the
Python ``llm`` runtime, with Node (Copilot) / Rust (Codex) tracked in #2034.
