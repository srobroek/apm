"""Regression traps for cross-package deployed-file ownership reconciliation.

``ctx.package_deployed_files`` is populated once per dep_key, independently,
by that dep's own integration call (see ``install/template.py``). When two
different packages' primitives resolve to the same on-disk path -- a name
collision, e.g. two repos both shipping a skill called ``shared-topic`` --
each package's own integration call correctly and independently reports "I
wrote this path" at the moment it ran. Without reconciliation, BOTH entries
end up claiming ``deployed_files`` for a path only one of them actually
owns on disk -- a lockfile integrity bug: a future ``apm uninstall`` or
``apm audit`` on the "losing" package would act on a file it does not
control. The claim decision belongs to ``DeploymentReconciler``.
