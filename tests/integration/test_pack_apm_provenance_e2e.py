"""Hermetic e2e coverage for provenance hardening of ``apm pack --format apm``.

The archive (``apm``) format is the default and most-used pack format
(consumed by apm-action + CI). This suite proves that dependency files are
verified against the per-file SHA-256 recorded in ``apm.lock.yaml``
(``deployed_file_hashes``) before they enter the bundle -- a deployed file
tampered after ``apm install`` must fail the pack loudly rather than ship
silently. It also proves cross-target path mapping does not produce false
mismatches, and that a directory symlink planted inside a deployed dir cannot
escape the project root into the bundle.
