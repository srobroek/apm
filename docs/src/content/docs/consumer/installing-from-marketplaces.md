title: Installing from marketplaces
description: Six ways consumers install APM-published plugins -- through APM, VS Code, Cursor, Copilot CLI, Claude Code, and Codex -- and the auth and cache layout of each.

A marketplace publisher (see
[Publish to a marketplace](../../producer/publish-to-a-marketplace/))
ships one `marketplace.json` that every major agent runtime can read.
This page covers the install side: which command each runtime
exposes, what authentication it needs, and where files land on disk.

The recommended path is `apm install`. It is the only path that gives
you a committed `apm.lock.yaml`, content-hash pinning, transitive
resolution, the pre-install security scan, and `apm audit --ci`
drift detection. Use a native command when you cannot install APM,
or when the runtime owns the install surface (VS Code Copilot Chat).

## Install patterns

| Runtime                         | Install command                                                         | Auth                                | Cache layout                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| APM (recommended)               | `apm marketplace add <owner>/<repo>` then `apm install <pkg>@<marketplace>` | Host token (`GITHUB_APM_PAT`, etc.) via git credential helper. | `apm_modules/` in the project; `~/.apm/cache/` for fetched refs.             |
| VS Code (GitHub Copilot Chat)   | Plugin marketplace UI; or `code --install-extension` for the marketplace itself. | VS Code GitHub sign-in.             | Per-user extension store managed by VS Code. APM artifacts stream from the marketplace at activation. |
| Cursor                          | Settings -> Plugins -> add marketplace URL.                             | Cursor account.                     | `~/.cursor/extensions/` per-user.                                            |
| GitHub Copilot CLI              | `gh copilot marketplace add <owner>/<repo>` then `gh copilot plugin install <pkg>`. | `gh auth login`.                    | `~/.config/gh/copilot/` per-user.                                            |
| Claude Code                     | `/plugin marketplace add <owner>/<repo>` then `/plugin install <pkg>`.  | Anthropic sign-in.                  | `~/.claude/plugins/` per-user; `.claude/` in-project when wired.             |
| OpenAI Codex CLI                | `codex plugin add <owner>/<repo>` then `codex plugin install <pkg>`.    | OpenAI sign-in.                     | `~/.codex/plugins/` per-user; `.codex/` in-project when wired.               |

Native commands above read whichever artifact the runtime expects.
Most read `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (Anthropic-compatible
schema); Codex reads `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. Producers
who enable both outputs reach every runtime from one repo.

## What you give up with native installs

Native runtime commands install the plugin and stop there. They do
not produce a project-scoped lockfile, do not run the APM security
scan, and do not participate in `apm audit --ci` drift detection. If
your team or org has adopted APM, prefer `apm install` even when a
native command exists -- the lockfile is what makes installs
reproducible across machines and CI.

| Capability                          | `apm install` | Native runtime install |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Project-scoped `apm.lock.yaml`      | yes           | no                     |
| Content-hash pinning                | yes           | no                     |
| Transitive dependency resolution    | yes           | no                     |
| Pre-install security scan           | yes           | no                     |
| `apm audit --ci` drift gate         | yes           | no                     |
| Cross-harness deploy from one ref   | yes           | no (per-runtime install) |

## Picking the install path

- **You are the only user on a workstation and the plugin is simple.**
  A native install is fine. Treat it as a personal tool, not project
  infrastructure.
- **The plugin will be used by a team or in CI.** Use `apm install`.
  Commit `apm.yml` and `apm.lock.yaml`. Every contributor gets the
  same bytes.
- **Your org has an `apm-policy.yml`.** `apm install` is the only
  path that enforces it. See
  [Governance on the consumer ramp](../governance-on-the-consumer-ramp/).

## Local and self-hosted marketplaces

`apm marketplace add` can register marketplaces from git repositories,
local files, or hosted `marketplace.json` catalogs. The same register /
browse / install / update workflow works against:

- **Local filesystem paths** -- `apm marketplace add /srv/marketplaces/agent-forge`
  (or a relative path, `~/code/marketplace`, or a direct
  `marketplace.json` file). Useful for privacy-sensitive packages,
  offline workflows, and air-gapped environments. Local marketplaces
  with relative plugin sources install by copying from disk via
  `LocalDependencySource`.
- **`file://` URIs** -- `apm marketplace add file:///srv/marketplaces/agent-forge.git`.
  Behaves the same as a local path.
- **Git HTTPS URLs with `#ref`** --
  `apm marketplace add https://gitlab.com/acme/agent-forge.git#v1.0.0`.
  APM strips the fragment into the stored ref. If you omit `#ref`
  (or `--ref`), APM warns because the default branch can move.
- **Hosted `marketplace.json` URLs** --
  `apm marketplace add https://catalog.example.com/marketplace.json --name catalog`.
  APM fetches the JSON directly over HTTPS, caches ETag/Last-Modified
  metadata, and records the source URL plus content digest in the
  lockfile when packages are installed from it.
- **Generic git URLs** -- any host APM does not classify as
  GitHub or GitLab family flows through subprocess `git` and
  `GitCache`. Includes Azure DevOps (auth via `ADO_APM_PAT`),
  Gitea, Bitbucket Server, and self-hosted git servers.
- **SSH URLs** -- `git@gitea.example.com:org/repo.git`. The host
  is extracted, classified, and routed through the matching fetcher.
  For in-repository plugins from GitLab and generic git marketplaces, APM
  keeps this consumer-selected SSH transport when it writes their concrete
  `git:` and `path:` entry to `apm.yml`. HTTPS registrations likewise remain
  HTTPS.

Marketplace publishers can route an entry through a configured APM package
registry with the entry's `registry` and semver `version` fields. Enable the
feature first with `apm experimental enable registries`; see
[Registries](../../guides/registries/). APM honors that route through the
package-registry resolver. Missing or malformed registry intent fails closed
instead of silently falling back to the plugin's Git source.

:::note[Hosted JSON is public HTTPS]
Hosted `marketplace.json` URLs are public HTTPS sources: APM does not
send custom auth headers. Use git-backed marketplaces for private
catalogs.
:::

For generic-git marketplaces, `marketplace.json` is fetched via a
sparse-cone clone (only the manifest path is downloaded); APM does
not forward `GITHUB_APM_PAT` or `GITLAB_APM_PAT` to non-GitHub /
non-GitLab hosts. Authentication falls through to the host's matching
`*_APM_PAT` variable (such as `ADO_APM_PAT`) or local git credential
helper when one is configured. See
[Authentication](../../getting-started/authentication/).

**Lockfile note.** Installs from a local marketplace record a
local-path source in `apm.lock.yaml`. Lockfiles produced this way
are machine-specific -- do not commit them into a shared repo. Remote
`marketplace.json` installs record `source_url` and `source_digest`
provenance. See [lockfile reference](../../reference/lockfile-spec/).

  surface for declared dependencies.
