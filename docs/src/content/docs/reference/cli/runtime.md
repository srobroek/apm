`apm runtime` is experimental. Subcommand names, flags, and the supported runtime list may change.

## Synopsis

```bash
apm runtime COMMAND [ARGS] [OPTIONS]
```

## Description

`apm runtime` manages AI CLI binaries used by APM workflows. It installs them from official sources, records their location, and reports the active runtime according to APM's preference order.

It does not install APM packages and does not deploy primitives. For that, see [`apm install`](../install/). For the `scripts:` block these runtimes execute, see the [quickstart](../../../quickstart/).

A runtime here is the AI CLI itself (`copilot`, `codex`, `llm`, `gemini`) -- the program that consumes the prompts and skills APM deploys. For the broader concept of harness targets that receive primitives, see [Primitives and targets](../../../concepts/primitives-and-targets/).

Workflow runtime adapters enforce wall-clock deadlines while output streams:
600 seconds for Copilot and 300 seconds for Codex. On expiry, APM terminates
and reaps the process instead of waiting for stdout to close first. The LLM
adapter has no fixed deadline.

## Subcommands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `setup RUNTIME` | Download and configure an AI runtime CLI. |
| `list` | List all known runtimes and their installation status. |
| `status` | Print the active runtime and the preference order `apm run` uses. |
| `remove RUNTIME` | Uninstall a runtime previously set up by APM. |

`RUNTIME` is one of: `copilot`, `codex`, `llm`, `gemini`.

### `apm runtime setup`

```bash
apm runtime setup RUNTIME [--version VERSION] [--vanilla]
```

Downloads the runtime binary from its official source and writes a default APM configuration that points at GitHub Models (free) where applicable. On Windows, setup scripts run through PowerShell automatically.

For Codex, APM verifies the GitHub Releases SHA-256 asset digest before extracting the archive and fails if the digest is missing or mismatched.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--version VERSION` | latest | Pin a specific upstream version. |
| `--vanilla` | off | Install the binary only. Skip APM-managed config; use the runtime's native defaults (e.g. OpenAI for Codex). |

### `apm runtime list`

```bash
apm runtime list
```

Prints a table of every supported runtime with its installation status, install path, and detected version.

### `apm runtime status`

```bash
apm runtime status
```

Prints the runtime preference order (`copilot -> codex -> gemini -> llm`) and the first runtime in that order that is currently installed. Explicit `apm run` scripts still execute the command body declared in `apm.yml`.

### `apm runtime remove`

```bash
apm runtime remove RUNTIME [-y]
```

Removes a runtime installed by `apm runtime setup`. Prompts for confirmation unless `-y` / `--yes` is passed. Does not touch runtimes installed outside APM.

## Examples

```bash
# Install Copilot CLI with APM defaults
apm runtime setup copilot

# Install Codex pinned to a specific version
apm runtime setup codex --version 0.20.0

# Install LLM with no APM-managed config
apm runtime setup llm --vanilla

# See what is installed and which one apm run will pick
apm runtime list
apm runtime status

# Uninstall without prompting
apm runtime remove gemini -y
```

## Supported runtimes

| Runtime | Description | Default config |
|---|---|---|
| `copilot` | GitHub Copilot CLI. | GitHub Models (free). |
| `codex` | OpenAI Codex CLI. | GitHub Models via global `~/.codex/config.toml`. |
| `llm` | Simon Willison's `llm` CLI with multiple providers. | GitHub Models. |
| `gemini` | Google Gemini CLI. | Native defaults. |

`--vanilla` skips the APM defaults column for any runtime and leaves the CLI configured as upstream ships it.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success. |
| `1` | Setup, removal, listing, or status failed. The error message names the cause. |
