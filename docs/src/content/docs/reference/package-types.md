APM supports five package layouts, each with distinct install semantics.
Pick the layout that matches the author's intent -- APM preserves it.

## Layout summary

| Root signal | Author intent | Install semantic |
|---|---|---|
| `.apm/` (with or without apm.yml) | "I have N independent primitives" | Hoist each primitive into the target's runtime dirs |
| `SKILL.md` (alone or with apm.yml -- HYBRID) | "I am one skill bundle" | Copy the whole bundle to `<target>/skills/<name>/` |
| `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (nested) | "I ship many skills in one repo" | Promote each nested skill to `<target>/skills/<name>/` |
| `hooks/*.json` only (no apm.yml or SKILL.md) | "I ship a set of harness hooks" | Deploy each hook to the target's `hooks/` directory |
| `plugin.json` / `.claude-plugin/` | Claude plugin collection | Dissect via plugin artifact mapping |

## APM package (`.apm/` directory)

The classic APM layout. Primitives live under `.apm/` in typed subdirectories.
`apm install` hoists each primitive into the consumer's runtime directories
individually.

```
my-package/
+-- apm.yml
+-- .apm/
    +-- skills/
    |   +-- pr-description/SKILL.md
    +-- agents/
    |   +-- reviewer.agent.md
    +-- instructions/
        +-- team-standards.instructions.md
```

**What gets installed:** each skill, agent, and instruction is copied to its
corresponding runtime directory (e.g. `.github/skills/`, `.github/agents/`).

**When to choose:** you are shipping multiple independent primitives that
consumers may override or extend individually.

## Skill bundle (`SKILL.md` at root)

A single skill with co-located resources. The presence of `SKILL.md` at the
package root tells APM: "this entire directory is one skill -- install it as
a unit."

An optional `apm.yml` alongside `SKILL.md` makes this a **HYBRID** package.
APM still installs it as a skill bundle, but gains dependency resolution,
version metadata, and script support from the manifest.

```
code-review-skill/
+-- SKILL.md
+-- agents/
|   +-- reviewer.agent.md
+-- assets/
|   +-- checklist.md
+-- scripts/
|   +-- lint-check.sh
+-- apm.yml            # optional -- enables dependencies and scripts
```

**What gets installed:** the entire directory tree is copied to
`<target>/skills/<name>/`, preserving internal structure.

**When to choose:** you are shipping one cohesive skill that bundles its own
agents, assets, or scripts. The skill's internal layout is part of its
contract -- APM will not rearrange it.

### Metadata model (HYBRID packages)

`apm.yml` and `SKILL.md` each own their `description` field
**independently** -- APM never merges or backfills one from the other.
The two strings serve different consumers:

- `apm.yml.description` is a short human-facing tagline rendered by
  `apm view`, `apm search`, `apm deps list`, and registry/marketplace
  listings.
- `SKILL.md` `description` (frontmatter) is the agent-runtime
  invocation matcher consumed by Claude, Copilot, and other runtimes
  per the agentskills.io spec. APM copies `SKILL.md` byte-for-byte
  into `<target>/skills/<name>/` and never reads or mutates this
  field.

Other apm.yml fields (`name`, `version`, `license`, `dependencies`,
`scripts`) are owned exclusively by `apm.yml` -- there is no
SKILL.md-side equivalent and nothing to merge. `allowed-tools` lives
exclusively in `SKILL.md` frontmatter and is consumed by the agent
runtime.

When you ship a HYBRID package, populate both descriptions
independently: keep `apm.yml.description` to a short tagline (under
~80 characters) and write `SKILL.md` in whatever length and tone the
agent runtime expects. `apm pack` warns when `apm.yml.description` is
missing so the human-facing surfaces do not degrade silently while
the agent runtime keeps working.

## Skill collection (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`)

A multi-skill package following the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) /
`npx skills` convention. Each skill lives in its own subdirectory under
`skills/` with its own `SKILL.md`.

An optional `apm.yml` at the root provides version metadata and dependencies.
If absent, APM synthesizes minimal metadata from the directory name.

```
azure-skills/
+-- skills/
|   +-- cosmos-db/
|   |   +-- SKILL.md
|   |   +-- examples/
|   +-- functions/
|   |   +-- SKILL.md
|   +-- aks/
|       +-- SKILL.md
+-- apm.yml            # optional
```

**What gets installed:** each `skills/<name>/` directory is promoted to
`<target>/skills/<name>/`, preserving internal structure. Equivalent to
installing N separate CLAUDE_SKILL packages.

**Selective install:** use `--skill <name>` to install only specific skills
from the bundle (repeatable). The selection is **persisted** in `apm.yml`
(as a `skills:` field) and `apm.lock.yaml` (as `skill_subset`), so
subsequent bare `apm install` commands are deterministic.
Use `--skill '*'` to reset and install all skills. `--skill` is additive
across separate installs (a later `--skill X` unions onto the existing pin
and never removes already-deployed skills) -- see
[apm install](../cli/install/).

```bash
# Install only two skills (persisted to apm.yml):
apm install microsoft/azure-skills --skill cosmos-db --skill functions

# Bare reinstall respects the persisted selection:
apm install

# Reset to all skills:
apm install microsoft/azure-skills --skill '*'
```

The `apm.yml` entry is promoted to dict form with a `skills:` list:

```yaml
dependencies:
  apm:
    - git: microsoft/azure-skills
      skills:
        - cosmos-db
        - functions
```

The sibling per-dependency `targets:` list uses the same object form to
limit which active harnesses receive a dependency's target-scoped
primitives.

**Validation rules:**
- Frontmatter `name` field (if present) must match the directory name.
- Frontmatter `description` should be present (warning if absent).
- All frontmatter values must be ASCII-only.
- Directory names must pass path-traversal checks.

**When to choose:** you maintain a curated collection of independent skills
in one repository (e.g. all Azure skills, all Firebase skills). Consumers
can install the full set or cherry-pick with `--skill`.

## Hook package (`hooks/*.json` only)

A package whose root contains `hooks/*.json` files but no `apm.yml`,
`SKILL.md`, or `plugin.json`. APM treats the whole directory as a hook
bundle: each hook JSON is deployed to the target's runtime hooks
directory.

```
my-hooks/
+-- hooks/
    +-- pre-commit.json
    +-- post-merge.json
```

**What gets installed:** every file under `hooks/` is deployed to the
target's hooks runtime path (e.g. `.github/hooks/` for Copilot,
`.claude/hooks/` for Claude).

**When to choose:** you ship a set of harness hooks with no other
primitives. If you also ship skills or instructions, prefer the `.apm/`
layout and put your hooks under `.apm/hooks/` so they install alongside
the rest.

## Plugin collection (`plugin.json`)

A Claude-native plugin layout. APM dissects the plugin artifacts and maps
them into runtime directories.

```
my-plugin/
+-- plugin.json
+-- agents/
|   +-- helper.agent.md
+-- skills/
    +-- search/SKILL.md
```

**What gets installed:** each artifact listed in `plugin.json` is mapped to
the appropriate runtime directory via `_map_plugin_artifacts`. Use `--skill`
to cherry-pick plugin skills by leaf name or manifest path, such as
`skills/productivity/grill-me`.

Declared component paths are requirements, not hints. If an `agents`,
`skills`, `commands`, or `hooks` entry is missing or escapes the plugin
root, install exits non-zero before deployment or lockfile commit. Likewise,
`--skill` exits non-zero when none of the manifest-declared skills match.
Omit an optional field or use an empty list when the plugin has no component
of that type.

**When to choose:** you already have a Claude plugin and want APM to
consume it without restructuring.
