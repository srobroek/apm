APM has five lifecycle steps. Most projects use all five; small ones use three.

```
   init  ->  install  ->  compile  ->  run
                                          |
                                          v
                                       audit
                                          |
                                          +--> back to install (fix drift)
```

`init` scaffolds the project. `install` resolves dependencies, scans them, and writes the lockfile. `compile` transforms primitives into the formats each agent harness expects. `run` invokes a script declared in `apm.yml`. `audit` rebuilds the deployed context in scratch and diffs it against your working tree to catch drift before it ships.

You will use `install` and `run` daily, `audit` in CI, and `init` and `compile` rarely.

## 1. INIT

```bash
apm init [project-name]
```

Scaffolds a new APM project in the current directory.

`apm init` writes an `apm.yml` manifest with sensible defaults for `name`, `author`, and `description`, plus empty dependency and script blocks. It records selected targets in `targets:`; author `.apm/` primitives yourself and run `apm install` or `apm compile` to create target output directories.

Targets are picked in priority order. An explicit `--target copilot,claude` flag wins. Otherwise an interactive checklist runs. Otherwise APM scans the working tree for signal directories (`.github/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.opencode/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, `.windsurf/`, `.kiro/`) and pre-checks every harness it finds. With `-y` and no flag, all detected harnesses are written into `apm.yml`. See [primitives and targets](/apm/concepts/primitives-and-targets/) for what each target actually receives.

**Common surprises**

- Re-running `apm init` in a directory that already has `apm.yml` warns and exits unless you pass `-y` (which overwrites the manifest).
- `targets:` must contain at least one target. Omit the field (or leave legacy `target:` blank) when you want auto-detection at compile time.

## 2. INSTALL

```bash
apm install [packages...]
```

Resolves the dependency graph declared in `apm.yml`, runs the security scan, and writes `apm.lock.yaml`.

Order of operations is deterministic and worth memorizing:

1. **Resolve** -- walk `dependencies` and `devDependencies` (APM packages, MCP servers, Claude skills, plugin collections), follow transitive deps, pick versions.
2. **Policy gate** -- if `apm-policy.yml` is discovered (locally or via your repo's org), every resolved dependency is checked against the allow-list before integration writes deployed files. Pass `--no-policy` to skip the org policy gate for one invocation; this does not bypass `apm audit --ci`.
3. **Scan** -- the pre-deploy security scan inspects every primitive for hidden Unicode (zero-width characters, bidi controls, tag characters). Critical findings block the install. Pass `--force` to deploy anyway.
4. **Integrate** -- write primitives into each target harness's native directory (`.github/`, `.claude/`, etc.) and merge MCP server configs into the harness-specific config files.
5. **Lockfile** -- write `apm.lock.yaml` with pinned versions, content hashes, and the resolved MCP server set.

`apm install` with no arguments installs from the existing manifest. `apm install <package>` adds a new dependency, re-runs the full pipeline, and updates both `apm.yml` and `apm.lock.yaml`. `--dry-run` runs steps 1 and 2 only and prints the plan. If that command bootstraps a new project, it keeps the generated `apm.yml` and explicit target selection while rolling back package and deployment writes.

:::note[Coming from npm?]
`apm install` mirrors `npm install` deliberately. The big difference: APM also runs a security scan and, if present, an org policy gate before writing deployed files.
:::

**Common surprises**

- The scan is not optional in normal operation. If you need to land an install with a known critical finding (for example, an upstream package you cannot patch yet), use `--force` and document the exception.
- Transitive MCP servers are gated behind explicit trust. If a deep dependency declares a new MCP server, re-declare it in your top-level `apm.yml` or use `--trust-transitive-mcp` in trusted environments.

## 3. COMPILE

```bash
apm compile [--target <list>]
```

Transforms the primitives in `.apm/` (and dependencies under `apm_modules/`) into harness-native files: `AGENTS.md` for Codex, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini, populated `.cursor/`, `.opencode/`, `.windsurf/`, `.kiro/` directories, and so on.

`apm install` deploys individual primitives but does not run aggregate
compilation. Run `apm compile` explicitly to generate root or distributed
context files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `GEMINI.md`. `apm run`
still compiles any `.prompt.md` files referenced by a script immediately
before execution.

The `--target` flag accepts a comma-separated list (`copilot,claude,cursor,opencode,codex,gemini,windsurf,kiro,agent-skills`) or `all`. `--dry-run` prints placement decisions without writing files. `--validate` checks primitive frontmatter and structure without producing output. `--watch` re-runs compilation on every change.

**Common surprises**

- Running `apm compile` does not re-run the security scan. The scan happens at install time. If you hand-edit primitives between installs, run `apm audit` to scan them.
- `--clean` removes orphaned `AGENTS.md` files from previous compilations. Without it, removed primitives can leave stale output behind.

**Read more:** [`apm compile` reference](/apm/reference/cli/compile/), [compilation guide](/apm/producer/compile/).

## 4. RUN

```bash
apm run <script-name> [--param key=value ...]
```

Executes a named script from the `scripts:` block in `apm.yml`.

The `scripts:` block is a flat string-to-string mapping, mirroring `package.json`:

```yaml
name: my-project
version: 0.1.0
scripts:
  start: copilot --prompt .apm/prompts/review.prompt.md
  review: copilot --prompt .apm/prompts/review.prompt.md
  test: pytest tests/
```

`apm run` with no script name runs `start`, matching npm. Before invoking the command, APM scans it for `.prompt.md` references, compiles each one to `.apm/compiled/<name>.txt`, and substitutes the compiled path into the command line. Use `--param key=value` (repeatable) to pass parameters that get interpolated into prompt frontmatter.

To preview what will run without executing, use `apm preview <script-name>`. It prints the original command, the rewritten command after prompt compilation, and the list of compiled files.

:::note[Coming from npm?]
The `scripts:` shape is intentionally identical to `package.json`. Object-form scripts (with `description`, `env`, etc.) are not supported; keep them strings.
:::

**Common surprises**

- A script that does not reference any `.prompt.md` file runs as-is. APM only rewrites the command when it finds `.prompt.md` arguments.
- Parameters passed with `--param` only reach prompt files. They do not become shell environment variables.

**Read more:** [`apm run` reference](/apm/reference/cli/run/), [agent workflows guide](/apm/producer/author-primitives/instructions-and-agents/).

## 5. AUDIT

```bash
apm audit                  # local: scan deployed files for hidden Unicode
apm audit --ci             # CI gate: lockfile consistency + drift replay
apm audit --file <path>    # standalone: scan an arbitrary file
```

`apm audit` is the explicit reporting and remediation tool that complements the built-in scan run by `install`. It has two modes worth understanding separately.

**Local mode** (`apm audit`, optionally with `--strip` or `--file <path>`) scans installed primitives -- or any file you point at -- for hidden Unicode and reports findings as text, JSON, SARIF, or markdown. With `--strip`, it removes hidden characters in place, preserving emoji and whitespace. Use `--dry-run` to preview the strip.

**CI mode** (`apm audit --ci`) runs the eight baseline consistency checks in order: `lockfile-exists`, `ref-consistency`, `deployed-files-present`, `no-orphaned-packages`, `skill-subset-consistency`, `config-consistency`, `content-integrity`, and `includes-consent`. After those pass, it performs an install-replay drift check. APM rebuilds the deployed context in a scratch directory and diffs it against your working tree, catching hand-edits to `apm_modules/` or generated files before they ship. Pass `--no-drift` to skip the replay in performance-constrained loops; pass `--no-fail-fast` to run all checks even after a failure. With `--policy <source>` it also evaluates org policy against the lockfile.

**Common surprises**

- `apm audit --ci` exits 1 on any failure -- this is the gate you wire into branch protection. The local `apm audit` exits 0 even when findings exist, unless you also pass `--strip` and writes fail.
- The drift check rebuilds the full context from scratch; on large repos, expect a few seconds of overhead. If your CI loop cannot afford it, narrow with `--no-drift` and accept reduced coverage.
