"""Dependency identity helpers -- key derivation, canonical strings, semver guards.

Extracted from ``reference.py`` to keep that module within the source
file-length guardrail. These are pure, stateless helpers with no dependency on
``DependencyReference`` internals; both ``DependencyReference`` and
``LockedDependency`` reuse them so the two identity models share one body shape
without collapsing their distinct local-detection semantics.

``normalize_package_repo_url`` is the single casing-normalization boundary for
package identity. Callers must not lowercase repository paths independently.
