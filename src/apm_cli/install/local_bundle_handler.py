"""CLI handler for ``apm install <local-bundle-path>`` (issue #1098).

Extracted from :mod:`apm_cli.commands.install` to keep that module under the
architecture invariant LOC budget enforced by
``tests/unit/install/test_architecture_invariants.py``.

The handler owns the imperative deploy path for local bundles -- it does NOT
go through the dependency resolver, registry, or org-policy gate.  Local
bundles are intentionally a separate code path because they short-circuit
network I/O (proven by the air-gap E2E test).

MCP wiring (#1207): bundles MAY ship a ``.mcp.json`` (Anthropic plugin
format) describing MCP servers.  After the per-target deploy loop, the
handler routes those entries through :func:`MCPIntegrator.install` so each
resolved target's native MCP config gets the servers in its own
format/location -- ``.mcp.json`` is Claude-Code-native, but Copilot,
Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini, etc. each have their own MCP config conventions.
The bundle's ``.mcp.json`` itself is metadata and never deployed verbatim.
