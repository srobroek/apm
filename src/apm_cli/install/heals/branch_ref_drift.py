"""Always-on heal: re-download when a branch ref's remote SHA has
advanced past the lockfile-recorded SHA.

Without this heal, ``lockfile_match=True`` would short-circuit via the
content-hash fallback (typical for virtual packages where install_path
is not a git repo), producing a 3-way inconsistency: resolved_commit
advances in the lockfile, content_hash and on-disk content stay stale.

See PR #1158 root-cause analysis. The L94 comment in
``_resolve_download_strategy`` ("Branches always fetch latest")
documented the intent; this heal is the enforcement.
