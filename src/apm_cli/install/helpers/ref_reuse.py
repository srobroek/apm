"""Run-scoped RefResolver reuse for semver resolution.

Extracted from :mod:`apm_cli.install.phases.resolve` to keep that phase
module within its LOC budget (see
``tests/unit/install/test_architecture_invariants.py``).

Multiple semver deps from the same upstream repo should share one

once per repo instead of once per dep.

    fingerprint is non-reversible and never stores the raw credential in the

    explicit ``host='github.com'`` and one with no host collapse to the same

    defeat the dedup. ``cache=None`` (the default caller behavior) builds a
