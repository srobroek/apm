"""Single source of truth for the 9-outcome policy-discovery routing table.

Both the install pipeline gate (``install/phases/policy_gate.py``) and
the non-pipeline preflight helper (``policy/install_preflight.py``) need
to translate a :class:`~apm_cli.policy.discovery.PolicyFetchResult` into
the same set of side-effects:

* emit the correct ``logger.policy_discovery_miss`` /
  ``logger.policy_resolved`` line for the outcome, and
* decide whether to fail closed -- raising
  :class:`~apm_cli.install.errors.PolicyViolationError` -- based on the
  project's ``policy.fetch_failure_default`` and the cached policy's
  own ``fetch_failure`` knob.

Before #832 those decisions were duplicated across the two files.  This
module is the extracted shared core; the two callers now only own the
logic that is genuinely different (how they react after routing -- e.g.
the dry-run preview path in ``install_preflight``, or the post-routing
enforcement gate in ``policy_gate``).

This is a refactor: the wording, the order of log calls per branch,
and the exact gating semantics match the pre-extraction behaviour.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fetch_result:
        Result of ``discover_policy_with_chain``.
    logger:
        An :class:`~apm_cli.core.command_logger.InstallLogger` (or any
        object exposing ``policy_resolved`` / ``policy_discovery_miss``).
        ``None`` is tolerated for non-CLI callers.
    fetch_failure_default:
        Project-side ``policy.fetch_failure_default``; one of
        ``"warn"`` (default) or ``"block"``.  Only consulted for
        outcomes in :data:`_OUTCOMES_HONORING_FETCH_FAILURE_DEFAULT`.
    raise_blocking_errors:
        When ``True`` (default), raise :class:`PolicyViolationError` for
        outcomes that demand fail-closed behaviour (hash mismatch,
        fetch failure under ``block``, cached_stale with
        ``policy.fetch_failure=block``).  When ``False`` (used by
        ``install --dry-run``), the function returns normally and the
        caller is expected to render a preview instead.

    -------
    Optional[ApmPolicy]
        The merged effective policy when the caller should proceed to
        per-dependency enforcement; ``None`` when the caller should
        skip enforcement (no policy resolved, or fail-open).
