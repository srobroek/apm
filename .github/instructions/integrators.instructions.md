# Integrator Architecture

## Design philosophy

APM runs inside repositories of any size — from single-package repos to monorepos with thousands of packages and deep dependency trees. Every integrator must assume it will operate at that scale. The architecture is built around two principles:

1. **One base, many file types.** All file-level integrators share a single `BaseIntegrator` infrastructure for collision detection, manifest-based sync, path security, link resolution, and file discovery. New integrators add *what* to deploy, never *how* to deploy. When logic belongs to more than one integrator, push it into `BaseIntegrator`.
2. **Pay only for what you touch.** Operations must be proportional to the files a single package deploys, not the size of the workspace or the total managed-files set. Pre-normalize once, partition once, look up in O(1). Avoid full-tree walks, per-file parent cleanup, or repeated set scans.

When evolving integration logic -- new file types, richer transforms, cross-package awareness -- preserve these properties. If a change would violate either principle, refactor the base class first. This subsystem is the integration-specific instance of the repo-wide single-canonical-owner rule; see architecture.instructions.md.

## Required structure

Every file-level integrator **must** extend `BaseIntegrator` and return `IntegrationResult`.

```python
from apm_cli.integration.base_integrator import BaseIntegrator, IntegrationResult

class FooIntegrator(BaseIntegrator):
    def find_foo_files(self, package_path: Path) -> List[Path]: ...
    def copy_foo(self, source: Path, target: Path) -> int: ...
    def integrate_package_foos(self, package_info, project_root: Path,
                               force: bool = False,
                               managed_files: set = None) -> IntegrationResult: ...
    def sync_integration(self, apm_package, project_root: Path,
                         managed_files: set = None) -> Dict[str, int]: ...
```

## Base-class methods — use, don't reimplement

Before writing custom logic, check whether `BaseIntegrator` already solves the problem. Duplicating behaviour that exists in the base class creates drift, bugs, and performance regressions.

| Operation | Use | Never |
|---|---|---|
| Collision detection | `self.check_collision(target_path, rel_path, managed_files, force)` | Custom existence checks |
| Link resolution | `self.init_link_resolver()` + `self.resolve_links()` | Direct `UnifiedLinkResolver` calls |
| File discovery | `self.find_files_by_glob(path, pattern, subdirs=)` | Ad-hoc `os.walk` / recursive globs |
| Path validation | `BaseIntegrator.validate_deploy_path()` | Inline `..` or prefix checks |
| File removal (sync) | `self.sync_remove_files(project_root, managed_files, prefix=, legacy_glob_dir=, legacy_glob_pattern=)` | Manual scan-and-delete |
| Empty-dir cleanup | `BaseIntegrator.cleanup_empty_parents(deleted, stop_at)` | Per-file parent removal loops |

If you need an operation the base class does not support, **add it to `BaseIntegrator`** so every integrator benefits.

## Wiring checklist (cli.py)

- **Install path**: record each `result.target_paths` entry in `dep_deployed` using `.as_posix()`.
- **Uninstall path**: call `BaseIntegrator.partition_managed_files()` once, pass the appropriate bucket to `sync_integration()`.
- **Exports**: add the new integrator to `src/apm_cli/integration/__init__.py`.

## Performance guidance

The specific techniques below exist to serve the "pay only for what you touch" principle. As the codebase evolves, new code must uphold the same standard — if a new feature would regress install/uninstall to O(N × M) where N is packages and M is managed files, find a better design.

- `managed_files` must be pre-normalized with `normalize_managed_files()` for **O(1)** set lookups — never iterate the set to find a path.
- `partition_managed_files()` runs a **single O(M) pass** over managed files — do not filter per-integrator.
- `cleanup_empty_parents()` does a **bottom-up batch** — never call `rmdir()` per deleted file.
- File-discovery globs must be **scoped** to known subdirectories, not walk the entire package tree.
- All path strings stored in `apm.lock` must use **forward slashes** (`.as_posix()`).
